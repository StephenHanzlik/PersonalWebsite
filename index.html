<h1>Indian Peaks Ski Mountaineering Journal</h1>
<h3> Glisse Alpinism in Boulder County</h3>
<p>Boulder County is home to some of the finest spring skiing in the state of Colorado.   Strong Westerly winds and ample snow fall result in large build ups of snow on eastern slopes that persist for most of the summer.   Infact, Boulder County, and its neighboring peaks, are home to the only remaining glaciers in Colorado.   These permanent snow feilds remain year round and make it possible for one to ski or snowboard 12 months out of the year.  This website serves as a chronicle of the summits and ridges that I have snowboarded, as well as a check list and guidebook for future descents.</p>
